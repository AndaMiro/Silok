# Silok (for Linux)

## PDF Viewer (Experimental)
Since I couldn’t find a PDF viewer I liked, I just made one.

## Features
Currently, the viewer supports PDF reading only.

## Installation
Just build it using Qt Creator. Or if you don’t want to bother, grab the executable and run it.

## How to use
Just run it, and you'll instinctively know what to do.

## Upcoming Features
- Scroll using hand gestures

- Marker and text placement

- Honestly, I don’t know what else to add.
